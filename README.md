Virginia Commonwealth University FIRE 622: Financial Markets and Institutions Through Their Data

## Course description

This course is designed as a introduction to Financial Markets and Institutions through the lens of the data they create, curate, and publish.  Many of these institutions regulated the industry and acquire a significant trove of data in their operation for the public good.  In this class we will develop data skills of management, wrangling, and vizualization as an introduction towards financial analytics.

Class time will be divided into institutional knowledge, data understanding, and data manipulation.  The deliverables for this class will primarily be in class participation thru interactive polling, homework assignments and projects, as well as a a mid-term and final exam.

By the end of the semester students will work on reproducible data analysis projects and answer detailed analysis questions.
