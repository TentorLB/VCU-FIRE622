# Exercise Directions

This file contains an exercise.  Please read the text and adjust the necessary code chunks (between \`\`\` symbols), to accomplish the stated goal.

The big picture vision is 

  1. Load dataset into R
  2. Tidy
      * Examine dataset format and individual column format
      * Convert columns to format useful for analysis
  3. Understand/Analysis data
      * Calculate additional fields
      * Filter
      * Aggregate
      * Visualize

The details are stepped through in individual chucks below.

# Short-Term Bond Portfolio

## 1, Import Portfolio

Find the text file (`iShares-Long-Term-Corporate-Bond-ETF_fund.csv`) for the bond portfolio in the data directory and load.  Use the `read.csv` function, the file format is a tad different than in the past it is a pipe deliminited file, you will need to specifiy the parameter `sep =` in the parameters. 

```{r BondPortfolio}

my_file       <- "../data/___"
bondPortfolio <- read.csv(___, sep = ___, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(bondPortfolio)

```

## 2. Tidy

In this section we will make certain that the data is prepared in the correct format for our follow up analysis.  It could involve (1) going back to the import command to make things easier to properly load on import, or (2) it may involve changing and adjusting data types. [e.g. `as.Date`, `as.numeric`]

### Review column names 

The function for the Column Names is `colname`

```{r ColumnNames}
___(bondPortfolio)
```

### Review number of records

The function to check the number of rows is `nrow`

```{r NumberRecord}
___(bondPortfolio)
```

### Review summary of import
This enables review of each column, the datatype and data summary; use the `summary' function.

```{r Summary}
___(bondPortfolio)
```

What concerns do you have?

### Convert Date values

Observe the columns types of data...

* Maturity is also a chacter string, and requires to be converted to a date format. (%B is for month spelled out)

Complete the as.Date function.

```{r CleanDate}
bondPortfolio$Maturity     <- as.Date(___,___)
summary(bondPortfolio)
```

### Convert Factor values


For our analysis it will be convienient to convert some character strings to factors.

```{r ConvertFactors}

bondPortfolio$AssetClass    <- as.factor(bondPortfolio$Asset.Class)
bondPortfolio$Sector        <- as.factor(bondPortfolio$Sector_)

summary(bondPortfolio)
```

## 3. Understand/Analyze

Once fields have the proper data type we can look at answering a number of business questions.

### Sum Market Value

What is the market value of the portfolio in millions?

```{r MarketValue}

mvMil <- ___

print(mvMil)
```


### AssetClass Filter for `Money Market`

Filter for the `Money Market` records

```{r MoneyMarket}
bondPortfolio %>%
  ___
```

### AssetClass Filter for `Cash`

Filter for the `Cash` records

```{r Cash}
___
```


### Plot Maturity vs Duration

If we show a graph of the maturity on the x axis and the DUration on the y axis.  Fill in the variable names.

```{r Plot01}
ggplot(bondPortfolio, aes(x=___, y=___)) +
  geom_point()

```
What do long Maturity Bonds have low duration?  What bonds are these?

### Long Maturity

Wow, look at some of these bonds, what businesses get to issue bonds over 80 years until final maturity!  Filter for bonds that have maturity beyond 2100-01-01.

```{r longMaturity}
longMaturity <- bondPortfolio %>%
                  ___
longMaturity
```


### Plot with Color

Add the astetic `color=` and use the secotr variable to have the graph adjust.

```{r Plot02}
ggplot(bondPortfolio, aes(x=Maturity, y=Duration, color=Sector)) +
  geom_point()

```


### Sector Breakdown


Let's use the tidyverse tools to summerize the market value and weight by the sector grouping.

What sector has the largest weight in this portfolio?

<< Your Answer Here >>

```{r SectorBreakdown}
 bondPortfolio %>% 
   group_by(___) %>% 
   summarize(MarketValueSum=sum(___), WeightSum=sum(___)) %>%
   arrange(desc(WeightSum))

```

### Portfolio Coupon

Let's calculate the average coupon reported.

```{r CouponAverage}

couponAverage <- sum(___)/sum(is.finite(bondPortfolio$Coupon))

print(couponAverage)
```
Would this coupon be the correct one to use as the portfolio coupon?  No, we need to do the weighted average to generate this.

Fill in the necessary parameters.

```{r CouponWeightedAverage}

couponWeightedAverage <- sum(bondPortfolio$___*bondPortfolio$___)/sum(bondPortfolio$Weight)

print(couponWeightedAverage)
```

### Portfolio Duration

How would we calculated the portfolio duration.  The duration is available for all the securities, we could try summing these.

```{r DurationAverage}

durationAverage <- sum(bondPortfolio$___)/sum(is.finite(bondPortfolio$Duration))

print(durationAverage)
```

This varies based on the number of instruments.  We need to normalize by the market value.

```{r DurationWeightedAverage}

durationWeightedAverage <- ___

print(durationWeightedAverage)
```


### Explore the portfolio

Come up with another breakdown that might be interesting for a portfolio manager.

```{r newBreakdown}
 bondPortfolio %>% 
   group_by(Sector) %>% 
   summarize(MarketValueSum=sum(MarketValue), WeightSum=sum(Weight)) %>%
   arrange(desc(WeightSum))

```

### Graph something

Come up with another graph that might be interesting for a portfolio manager.

```{r }
ggplot(bondPortfolio, aes(x=Maturity, y=Duration, color=Sector)) +
  geom_point()

```
