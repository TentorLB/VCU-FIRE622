## Term Structure of Interest Rates:the Yield Curve

(a)  Upward sloping
(b)  Inverted or downward sloping
(c)  Flat

## Unbiased Expectations Theory

Current long-term interest rates (1RN) are geometric averages of current and expected future, E(Nr1), short-term interest rates

$_1R_N = [(1+_1R_1)(1+E(_2r_1))...(1+E(_Nr_n))]^{1/N}-1$

$_1R_N$  = actual N-period rate today
$N$      = term to maturity, N = 1, 2, …, 4, …
$_1R_1$  = actual current one-year rate today
E(_ir_1) = expected one-year rates for years, i = 1 to N

## Liquidity Premium Theory


$_1R_N = [(1+_1R_1)(1+E(_2r_1) + L_2)...(1+E(_Nr_n)+L_N)]^{1/N}-1$

$L_i$  = liquidity premium for period t
$L_2 < L_3 < … < L_N$

## Market Segmentation Theory

- Individual investors and FIs have specific maturity preferences
- Interest rates are determined by distinct supply and demand conditions within many maturity segments
- Investors and borrowers deviate from their preferred maturity segment only when adequately compensated to do so
