# Exercise Directions

This file contains an exercise.  Please read the text and adjust the necessary code chunks (between \`\`\` symbols), to accomplish the stated goal.  The entire project will not knit since sections of the code have been filled with `___` where you need to complete the code.  Use the run above and run button on each chunk for intermediate results.

The big picture vision is 

  1. Load data set into R
  2. Tidy
      * Examine data set format and individual column format
      * Convert columns to format useful for analysis
  3. Understand/Analysis data
      * Calculate additional fields
      * Filter
      * Aggregate
      * Visualize

# Local Currency Bond Portfolio

## 1. Import Portfolio

* Be very careful with column names within the file and dataset they may not be the same as prior files. When you have errors check this first! *

Find the text file (`iShares-JP-Morgan-EM-Local-Currency-Bond-ETF_fund.csv`) for the bond portfolio in the data directory and load.  Use the `read.csv` function, the file format is a tad different than in the past it is a pipe deliminited file, you will need to specify the parameter `sep =` in the parameters. 

```{r BondPortfolio}

___
___

head(bondPortfolio)

```

## 2. Tidy

In this section we will make certain that the data is prepared in the correct format for our follow up analysis.  It could involve (1) going back to the import command to make things easier to properly load on import, or (2) it may involve changing and adjusting data types. [e.g. `as.Date`, `as.numeric`]

### Review column names 

The function for the Column Names is `colname`

```{r ColumnNames}
___
```

### Review number of records

The function to check the number of rows is `nrow`

```{r NumberRecord}
___
```

### Review summary of import
This enables review of each column, the datatype and data summary.

```{r Summary}
___
```

### Convert Factor values

For the rest of the analysis you will need factor for the Asset Class, Sector, Location and Currency.
