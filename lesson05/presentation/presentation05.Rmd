## Problem B: House Refinace

Five years ago you purchased a $360,000 house.  You paid 20% down to avoid PMI fees.  At this time, you paid 5% on a 30-year mortgage.

You believe that it may be a good time to refinance with current rates running at 4% for a 30 year mortgage.  It will cost around $2500 in fees to refinance.  How many months would it take to recoup these fees? 

--

What steps are necessary?

--

a. Principle remaining on first loan?
$principle_n = (1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^{term*12-n}})/r/((1-(1+r)^{term*12})/r)*principle_0$

## Problem B: House Refinace- Step 1

Five years ago you purchased a $360,000 house.  You paid 20% down to avoid PMI fees.  At this time, you paid 5% on a 30-year mortgage.

You believe that it may be a good time to refinance with current rates running at 4% for a 30 year mortgage.  It will cost around $2500 in fees to refinance.  How many months would it take to recoup these fees? 


```{r B-1, echo=TRUE}
purchase    <- 360000
term        <- 30                   # Annual term
termM       <- term*12              # Monthly term
rate        <- 0.05                 # Annual rate
rateM       <- rate/12              # Monthly rate
downpayment <- 0.20 * purchase
principle   <- purchase - downpayment
pmt         <- principle/((1- (1/((1+rateM)^(termM)))) /rateM)
principle_60 <- ((1 - (1/((1+rateM)^(termM-60))))/rateM) /
                ((1 - (1/((1+rateM)^(termM   ))))/rateM) * principle
c(principle, pmt, principle_60)

## Problem B: House Refinace- Step 2

Five years ago you purchased a $360,000 house.  You paid 20% down to avoid PMI fees.  At this time, you paid 5% on a 30-year mortgage.

You believe that it may be a good time to refinance with current rates running at 4% for a 30 year mortgage.  It will cost around $2500 in fees to refinance.  How many months would it take to recoup these fees? 

```{r B-2, echo=TRUE}
term2       <- 30                   # Annual term
term2M      <- term2*12             # Monthly term
rate2       <- 0.04                 # Annual rate
rate2M      <- rate/12              # Monthly rate
pmt2        <- principle_60/((1- (1/((1+rate2M)^(term2M)))) /rate2M)
savingM    <- pmt - pmt2
nBreakeven  <- ceiling(2500/savingM)
