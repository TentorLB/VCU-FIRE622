# Federal Reserve Bank API

You must complete the following steps
  1. Register for a Federal Reserve Bank API key
  2. Create a text file on your local machine. (In windows Explorer > right click > New > Create Document)
  3. Save the file with the name "FRED.key"
  4. Place the key on the first line of the text file and save
  5. Transfer file to lesson05 directory.

```{r}
# Read Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) user key
#
# This will need to be configured for each user 
# by signing up for an account at
# https://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/apikeys
#
# Then place the api key on the first line of the file FRED.key in the lesson directory.
#
# This key is a long hex number that looks like
#
# ffff231e4928f1f49bb4a3699834d3ca

fredFile          <- read.csv('../FRED.key', header = FALSE, sep = ",", dec = ".", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

### Assembly data: Stack

- Can you think of a time you have stacked data

```{r}
#colnames(mortgageDebtResidential)[3] <- 'Residential'
#colnames(mortgageDebtFarm)[3]        <- 'Farm'

# Wide
#mortgageEnhanced <- mortgageDebtResidential %>% inner_join(mortgageDebtFarm, by = c("date"))

#Stacked
mortgageStack    <- rbind(mortgageDebtResidential,mortgageDebtFarm)
head(mortgageStack %>% filter(date == '1995-10-01'))
```
### Assembly data: Wide

- Can you think of a time you have stacked data

```{r}
# Wide
mortgageDebtResidential_              <- mortgageDebtResidential
colnames(mortgageDebtResidential_)[3] <- 'Residential'

mortgageDebtFarm_                     <- mortgageDebtFarm
colnames(mortgageDebtFarm_)[3]        <- 'Farm'

mortgageWide                          <- 
  mortgageDebtResidential_ %>% 
  inner_join(mortgageDebtFarm_, by = c("date"))

head(mortgageWide)

```


### Graph 1995

```{r}

mortgage1995 <- mortgageStack %>% filter(date=='1995-10-01')

mortgage19952016 <- mortgageStack %>% filter(date=='1995-10-01' | date=='2016-10-01')
mortgage19952016

```

Bar Plot

```{r}

barPlot   <- ggplot(mortgage1995, aes(x="", y=value, fill=name))+
               geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")

```


Pie Chart

```{r}

               geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
               coord_polar("y", start=0)
pieChart

```

### Graph 1995 & 2016

```{r}
