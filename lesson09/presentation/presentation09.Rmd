Exam has a distribution as expected from my experience.  The good news is that this exam only accounts for 15% of the grade.  The class as originally designed has a larger weight to projects. Those that would like to discuss their grades and concerns should schedule a one-on-one meeting time.

# Stock Market Overview

# Stock Market Overview

- Primary stock markets allow suppliers of funds to raise equity capital.
- Secondary stock markets are the most closely watched and reported of all financial markets.
- Stockholders are the legal owners of a corporation.
    - Have a right to share in the firm’s profits (Example: through dividends).
    - Are residual claimants.
    - Have limited liability.
    - Have voting rights (Example: to elect board of directors).

---
class: inverse, mline, center, middle
# Stock Market Securities

---
# Common Stock

- **Common stock** is the fundamental ownership claim in a public or private corporation
- **Dividends** are discretionary, and are thus not guaranteed
- Common stockholders have the lowest priority claim in the event of bankruptcy, also refered to as a residual claim.
- **Limited liability** implies that common stockholders can lose no more than their original investment
- Common stockholders control the firm’s activities indirectly by exercising their **voting rights** in the election of the board of directors

---
# Common Stock Voting Rights

- **Dual-class firms** have two classes of common shares outstanding, with different voting rights assigned to each class.
    - [Ford](https://www.thebalance.com/examples-of-dual-class-structures-358090)
    - [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/compab.pdf)
    - [Google](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/whats-difference-between-googles-goog-and-googl-stock-tickers.asp)
- With **cumulative voting**, the number of votes assigned to each stockholder equals the number of shares held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected.
    - The number of shares needed to elect $p$ directors, $N_p$, is:
    - $N_p$ = [( $p$ x # of votes available) / (# of directors to be elected + 1)] +1
    - A proxy vote allows stockholders to vote by absentee ballot (Example: by internet or by mail).

# Stock Returns
- The return on a stock over one period ( $r_t$ ) can be divided into capital gains and dividend returns:

.font150[.center[
$r_t = \frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}+\frac{D_t}{P_{t-1}}$
]]

| Expression                    | Meaning |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| $P_t$                         | Stock **P**rice at time $t$|
| $D_t$                         | **D**ividends paid over time $t–1$ to $t$|
| $\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$ | Return from Capital Gain over time $t–1$ to $t$|
| $\frac{D_t}{P_{t-1}}$         | Return from Dividends over time $t–1$ to $t$|

---
# Stock Return Example

Suppose an investor buys 10 shares of stock priced at &dollar;55.10 and sells the stock one year later for &dollar;56.30 after collecting a &dollar;0.30 dividend per share. What was the investor’s pre-tax holding period return?

$r_{HoldingPeriod}=\frac{65.30-55.10}{55.10}+\frac{0.30}{55.10}=2.18\%+0.54\%=2.72\%$

If dividend income is taxed at a 28% rate and capital gains are taxed at 20%, what was the investor’s after-tax holding period return?

$r_{AfterTax}=[r_{CapitalGains}*(1-20\%)]+[r_{Dividend}*(1-28\%)]$
$r_{AfterTax}=[2.18\%*(1-20\%)]+[0.54\%*(1-28\%)] = 2.13\%$

# Zoom Breakout Room

- I am about to assign a problem for you.
- I will send you to breakout rooms for five minutes.
- **You might need to reference the presention in your own session**.
- You should do problem individually.

# Problem A

You buy a stock for $50 per share and sell it for $53 after holding it for slightly over a year and collecting a $2.00 per share dividend. Your ordinary income tax rate is 28 percent and your capital gains tax rate is 20 percent. Your after-tax rate of return is ___________________.

---
class: inverse
# Answer A

.font150[.center[
$r_t = \frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}×(1-T_{cg})+\frac{D_t}{P_{t-1}}×(1-T_{div})$
]]

$r_t = \frac{53-50}{50}×(1-0.20)+\frac{2.00}{50}×(1-0.28)$
$r_t = 0.048 + 0.0288$
$r_t = 0.0768 = 7.68\%$

# Preferred Stock

**Preferred stock** is a hybrid security that has characteristics of both bonds and common stock.
- Similar to common stock in that it represents an ownership interest in the issuing firm, but like a bond it pays a fixed periodic (dividend) payment.
- Generally has **fixed dividends** that are paid quarterly.
- Generally **does not have voting rights** unless dividend payments are missed.
- **Nonparticipating** versus **participating**.
- **Cumulative** versus **noncumulative**.

# Primary and Secondary Markets

---
# Primary Markets .font50[1]

**Primary markets** are markets in which corporations raise funds through new issues of securities, most of the time through **investment banks**.
Example: Morgan Stanley or Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

- Investment banks act as distribution agents in **best efforts underwriting**.
- Investment banks act as principals in **firm commitment underwriting**.
    gross proceeds − net proceeds = underwriter’s spread
- A **syndicate** is a group of investment banks working in concert to issue stock; the lead underwriter is the **originating house**.

---
# Primary Markets .font50[2]

- An **initial public offering (IPO)** is the first public issue of financial instruments by a firm.
- A **seasoned offering** is the sale of additional securities by a firm whose securities are already publicly traded.
- **Preemptive rights** give existing stockholders the ability to maintain their proportional ownership.
- **Shelf registration** allows firms to offer multiple issues of stock over a two-year period with only one registration statement.

???
A red herring prospectus is a preliminary version of the prospectus that describes a new security issue.

---
# Secondary Markets

**Secondary stock markets** are the markets in which stocks, once issued, are traded among investors.
The U.S. has several major stock markets.
- **New York Stock Exchange Euronext (NYSE/Euronext)**.
    - The NYSE/Euronext Exchange was purchased by ICE in 2013.
- **National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ)**
- **Bats/Direct Edge (former ECNs)**

- Each stock has a special market maker called a specialist or Designated Market Maker (DMM) that maintains liquidity for the stock at all times.
- Trading occurs at a specific place on the floor of the exchange called a trading post.
    - Three types of transactions occur at trading posts.
        - A **market order** is an order to transact at the best price available when the order reaches the trading post.
        - A **limit order** is an order to transact at a specified price.
        - Specialists transact for their own account.

- **Program trading** is the simultaneous buying and selling of a portfolio of at least 15 different stocks valued at more than $1 million using computer programs to initiate the trades.
- **Circuit breakers** give investors time to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility.

# Problem B

Suppose you own 20,000 shares of common stock in a firm with 2.5 million total shares outstanding. The firm announces a plan to sell an additional 0.5 million shares through a rights offering. The market value of the stock is $45 before the rights offering and the new shares are being offered to existing shareholders at a $5 discount.
 
- a. If you exercise your preemptive rights, how many of the new shares can you purchase?
- b. What is the market value of the stock before the rights offering?
- c. What is the market value of the stock after the rights offering?

# Answer B

Suppose you own 20,000 shares of common stock in a firm with 2.5 million total shares outstanding. The firm announces a plan to sell an additional 0.5 million shares through a rights offering. The market value of the stock is $45 before the rights offering and the new shares are being offered to existing shareholders at a $5 discount.
 
- a. If you exercise your preemptive rights, how many of the new shares can you purchase?

**Answer**
- a. 0.5 million new shares from 2.5 million original shares => 1 new share for every 5 original shares. So we may purchase 4,000 new shares. Your current ownership interest is 0.8 percent (20,000/2.5 million) prior to the rights offering and you receive 4,000 rights (20,000 × 0.2) allowing you to purchase 4,000 of the new shares. If you exercise your rights (buying the 4,000 shares) your ownership interest in the firm after the rights offering is still 0.8 percent ((20,000 + 4,000)/(2.5 million + 0.5 million)).

The market value of the stock is $45 before the rights offering and the new shares are being offered to existing shareholders at a $5 discount.

- c. What is the market value of the stock after the rights offering?

**Answer**
- c. The 0.5 million new shares are offered to current stockholders at a $5 discount, or for $40 per share. The firm receives $20 million. The market value of the firm after the rights offering is $132.5 million (the original $112.5 million plus the $20 million from the new shares), or $44.167 per share ($132.5 million/3 million).

# Economic Indiciators

- Economic indicators
    - Stock market indexes might be used to forecast future economic activity.
    - An increase (decrease) in stock market indexes today potentially signals the market’s expectation of higher (lower) corporate dividends and profits and, in turn, higher (lower) economic growth.
    - Stock prices are one of the 10 variables included in the index of leading economic indicators used by the Federal Reserve as it formulates economic policy.

# Market Efficiency .font50[1]

- **Market efficiency** refers to the speed with which financial security prices reflect unexpected news events.
    - (1) Weak form market efficiency
        - Concludes that investors cannot make more than the fair (required) return using information based on historical price movements.
        - Empirical research suggests that markets are weak form efficient.
    - (2) Semistrong form market efficiency
        - According to semistrong form market efficiency, investors cannot make more than the fair (required) return by trading on public news releases.
        - Note that if semistrong form market efficiency holds, weak form market efficiency must hold as well.
---
# Market Efficiency .font50[2]

- **Market efficiency** refers to the speed with which financial security prices reflect unexpected news events.
    - (3) Strong form market efficiency
        - States that stock prices fully reflect all information about the firm, both public and private.
        - According to strong form efficiency, even learning private information about the firm is of not help in earning more than the required rate of return.
        - Limited empirical testing, but studies do suggest that corporate insiders earn abnormal returns from trading and the more informed the insider, the more often abnormal returns are earned.
        - For this reason, laws prohibit investors from trading on the basis of private information.

- U.S. stock markets are the world’s largest.
- European markets have increased their share of the global market with the advent of a common currency, the Euro, but hurt by the Euro area crisis.
- Growth has strengthened China and Pacific Basin countries.
- International stock markets allow investors to diversify by holding stocks issued by corporations in foreign countries.
- International diversification can increase risk due to incomplete information about foreign stocks as well as foreign exchange and political risk.

# American Depository Receipts (ADRs)

An ADR is a certificate that represents ownership of a foreign stock.
- Created by a U.S. bank, after acquiring stock in foreign corporations in their domestic currencies.
- The bank then issues dollar ADRs backed by the shares of the foreign stock, investors earn returns in U.S. dollars.

There are currently over 3,600 ADRs of foreign corporations available to U.S. investors representing asset values of over $3.1 trillion in 2015.

There are 3 types of ADRs:
- **Level 1 ADRs** trade OTC and are not required to meet U.S. GAAP nor issue annual reports.
- **Level 2 ADRs** trade on the exchanges and must meet exchange requirements and adhere to U.S. reporting standards.
- **Level 3 ADRs** meet the same reporting standards as Level 2 and must register with the SEC and file the equivalent of 10K forms. These firms are allowed to raise public capital in the U.S.
