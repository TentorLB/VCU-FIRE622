Exam has a distribution as expected from my experience.  The good news is that this exam only accounts for 15% of the grade.  The class as originally designed has a larger weight to projects. Those that would like to discuss their grades and concerns should schedule a one-on-one meeting time.

This module covers a number of different aspects of stock markets.

# Stock Market Overview

---
# Stock Market Overview

- Primary stock markets allow suppliers of funds to raise equity capital.
- Secondary stock markets are the most closely watched and reported of all financial markets.
- Stockholders are the legal owners of a corporation.
    - Have a right to share in the firm’s profits (Example: through dividends).
    - Are residual claimants.
    - Have limited liability.
    - Have voting rights (Example: to elect board of directors).

# Stock Market Securities

---
# Common Stock

- **Common stock** is the fundamental ownership claim in a public or private corporation
- **Dividends** are discretionary, and are thus not guaranteed
- Common stockholders have the lowest priority claim in the event of bankruptcy (That is a residual claim)
- **Limited liability** implies that common stockholders can lose no more than their original investment
- Common stockholders control the firm’s activities indirectly by exercising their **voting rights** in the election of the board of directors

---
# Common Stock Voting Rights

- **Dual-class firms** have two classes of common shares outstanding, with different voting rights assigned to each class.
- With **cumulative voting**, the number of votes assigned to each stockholder equals the number of shares held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected.
    - The number of shares needed to elect $p$ directors, $N_p$, is:
    - $N_p$ = [( $p$ x # of votes available) / (# of directors to be elected + 1)] +1
    - A proxy vote allows stockholders to vote by absentee ballot (Example: by internet or by mail).

---
# Stock Returns
- The return on a stock over one period (Rt) can be divided into capital gains and dividend returns:

.font150[.center[
$r_t = \frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}+\frac{D_t}{P_{t-1}}$
]]

| Expression                    | Meaning |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| $P_t$                         | Stock **P**rice at time $t$|
| $D_t$                         | **D**ividends paid over time $t–1$ to $t$|
| $\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$ | Return from Capital Gain over time $t–1$ to $t$|
| $\frac{D_t}{P_{t-1}}$         | Return from Dividends over time $t–1$ to $t$|

---
# Stock Return Example

Suppose an investor buys 10 shares of stock priced at &dollar;55.10 and sells the stock one year later for &dollar;56.30 after collecting a &dollar;0.30 dividend per share. What was the investor’s pre-tax holding period return?

$r_{HoldingPeriod}=\frac{65.30-55.10}{55.10}+\frac{0.30}{55.10}=2.18\%+0.54\%=2.72\%$

If dividend income is taxed at a 28% rate and capital gains are taxed at 20%, what was the investor’s after-tax holding period return?


$r_{AfterTax}=[r_{CapitalGains}*(1-20\%)]+[r_{Dividend}*(1-28\%)]$
$r_{AfterTax}=[2.18\%*(1-20\%)]+[0.54\%*(1-28\%)] = 2.13\%$

---
# Preferred Stock

**Preferred stock** is a hybrid security that has characteristics of both bonds and common stock.
- Similar to common stock in that it represents an ownership interest in the issuing firm, but like a bond it pays a fixed periodic (dividend) payment.
- Generally has **fixed dividends** that are paid quarterly.
- Generally **does not have voting rights** unless dividend payments are missed.
- **Nonparticipating** versus **participating**.
- **Cumulative** versus **noncumulative**.

# Primary and Secondary Markets

---
# Primary Markets

**Primary markets** are markets in which corporations raise funds through new issues of securities, most of the time through **investment banks**.
Example: Morgan Stanley or Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

- Investment banks act as distribution agents in **best efforts underwriting**.
- Investment banks act as principals in **firm commitment underwriting**.
    gross proceeds − net proceeds = underwriter’s spread
- A **syndicate** is a group of investment banks working in concert to issue stock; the lead underwriter is the **originating house**.

---
# Primary Markets 2

- An **initial public offering (IPO)** is the first public issue of financial instruments by a firm.
- A **seasoned offering** is the sale of additional securities by a firm whose securities are already publicly traded.
- **Preemptive rights** give existing stockholders the ability to maintain their proportional ownership.
- **Shelf registration** allows firms to offer multiple issues of stock over a two-year period with only one registration statement.

???
A red herring prospectus is a preliminary version of the prospectus that describes a new security issue.

---
# Secondary Markets

**Secondary stock markets** are the markets in which stocks, once issued, are traded among investors.
The U.S. has several major stock markets.
- **New York Stock Exchange Euronext (NYSE/Euronext)**.
    - The NYSE/Euronext Exchange was purchased by ICE in 2013.
- **National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ)**
- **Bats/Direct Edge (former ECNs)**

# NYSE Euronext

- Each stock has a special market maker called a specialist or Designated Market Maker (DMM) that maintains liquidity for the stock at all times.
- Trading occurs at a specific place on the floor of the exchange called a trading post.
    - Three types of transactions occur at trading posts.
        - A **market order** is an order to transact at the best price available when the order reaches the trading post.
        - A **limit order** is an order to transact at a specified price.
        - Specialists transact for their own account.

- **Program trading** is the simultaneous buying and selling of a portfolio of at least 15 different stocks valued at more than $1 million using computer programs to initiate the trades.
- **Circuit breakers** give investors time to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility.
