## Exercise Directions

This file contains an exercise.  Please read the text and adjust the necessary code chunks (between \`\`\` symbols), to accomplish the stated goal.

## Time Value of Money

### Load Federal Funds Rate

As a bank employee you are responsible for your reserves with the Federal Reserve System.

You need to monitor the Federal Funds rate and calculate the earnings from excess Reserves or the costs of borrowing others reserves.

Determine the file name for the Federal Funds within the data directory.

```{r FederalFunds}
my_file <- "../data/FEDFUNDS.csv"

# Review help file lines
# ?read.csv

fedfund <- read.csv(my_file, header = TRUE, colClasses = c("Date","numeric"))

tail(fedfund)
```


### November 2019 Reserves

If our bank had 10,000,000 USD in excess reserves for one day how much interest would it earn at the federal funds rate.

```{r Interest}

cash      <- 10000000
obs       <- subset(fedfund,DATE==as.Date("2019-10-01"))
r         <- obs$FEDFUNDS

interest  <- r/100/365*cash

print(interest)

```


## Session Info

```{r}
devtools::session_info()
```

```{r}
date()
sessionInfo()
```

```{r}
date()
Sys.getenv()
```
