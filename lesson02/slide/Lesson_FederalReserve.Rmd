## Key Functions of the Federal Reserve System
![](../image/StructureoftheFederalReserveSystem.jpg "System"){width=750px}
[@FRB]

## The Five Key Functions {.flexbox .vcenter}

  1. Conducting Monetary Policy
  2. Promoting Financial System Stability
  3. Supervising and Regulating Financial Institutions and Activities
  4. Fostering Payment and Settlement System Safety and Efficiency
  5. Promoting Consumer Protection and Community Development
  
  
## 1. Conducting Monetary Policy {.flexbox .vcenter}
  
* Monetary policy affects the macroeconomy by influencing the supply and demand for excess bank reserves.
* Influences the money supply and the level of short-term and long-term interest rates.
* Affects foreign exchange rates, the amount of money and credit in the economy, and the levels of employment, output, and prices.

## 1. Conducting Monetary Policy (continued) {.flexbox .vcenter}

* Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
    - FOMC consists of twelve (12) members.
    - All (7) members of the Board of Governors.
    - The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    - The presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks (on a rotating basis).
    - The major monetary policy-making body of the FRS
* [Meetings and press releases](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)

## 1. Conducting Monetary Policy (continued) {.flexbox .vcenter}

* Policies seek to promote full employment, economic growth, price stability, and a sustainable pattern of international trade.
* Are there tradeoffs between these goals?
* Why is international monetary cooperation necessary?

## 1. Conducting Monetary Policy (continued) {.flexbox .vcenter}

* The FOMC sets ranges for growth of monetary aggregates and the fed funds rate, and also directs operations in FX markets.
* Open market operations are the main policy tool used to achieve monetary targets:
    - involve the purchase and sale of U.S. government and federal agency securities.
    - are implemented by the Federal Reserve Board Trading Desk of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.

## Open market operations {.flexbox .vcenter}

* Policy directive of the FOMC is forwarded to the Federal Reserve Board Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
* Trading Desk manager buys or sells U.S. Treasury securities in the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which keeps the fed funds rate near its desired target.
* FRBNY acts through the Trading Desk to implement policy directives each business day.
    - Operations may be permanent or temporary.
    - May use repurchase agreements for temporary increases or decreases in excess reserves.


## Monetary Policy

## Discount Rate

* The discount rate is the rate Federal Reserve Banks charge on loans to financial institutions in their district.
* The Federal Reserve rarely uses the discount rate as a policy tool.
    - Discount rate changes are strong signals of the Federal Reserves intentions.
    - There is no guarantee that banks will borrow, nor that they will lend.
  
## 3. Supervising and Regulating Financial Institutions and Activities {.flexbox .vcenter}

* The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of July 2010 requires the Fed to supervise complex financial institutions that could generate systemic risk to the economy.
* The Fed (and others) has now been given broader powers to seize or break up institutions whose actions could harm the economy.


## 5. Promoting Consumer Protection and Community Development  {.flexbox .vcenter}

* Implementing federal laws designed to protect consumers in credit and other financial transactions.  
* Implementing regulations to ensure compliance, investigating complaints, and ensuring availability of services to low and moderate income groups and certain geographic regions.
