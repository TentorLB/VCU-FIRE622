## FIRE 622: Financial Management of Financial Institutions. 3 Hours.

This course is designed as a introduction to Financial Markets and Institutions through the lens of the data they create, curate, and publish.  Many of these institutions regulated the industry and acquire a significant trove of data in their operation for the public good.  In this class we will develop data skills of management, wrangling, and visualization as an introduction towards financial analytics.

Class time will be divided into institutional knowledge, data understanding, and data manipulation.  The deliverables for this class will primarily be in class participation through interactive polling, homework assignments and projects, as well as a a mid-term and final exam.

By the end of the semester students will work on reproducible data analysis projects and answer detailed analysis questions.

## Texts and Software

We will be using the McGraw Hill Education platform, Connect and Learn Smart, to access Financial Markets & Institutions (Saunders, 7e).  The Connect Access Card has the ISBN 9781260166088.  This will provide active reading and chapter quizzes.  The Connect platform provides two free weeks of access to the class material to assist during the drop/add period.  After this the access card may be obtained through the bookstore or directly online through McGraw-Hill.

We will also use additional open source texts for R.  Including Hands-On Programming with R [@GrolemundData] and others. 

We will also be using the programming language R to do data manipulation and analysis.  We will start the semester off using RStudio in the Cloud.  If projects become to demanding it may be necessary to locally install R and RStudio.  Third party accounts are necessary for McGraw Hill Connect, RStudio in the Cloud, and Slack (for class communication/messaging).  The course website is located on VCU's Blackboard platform (http://blackboard.vcu.edu).

Each student is responsible to submit homework and is expected to read the assigned readings.  Homework may be discussed with others, while any exams are to be completed independently and pledged. The projects will be applied analysis work that is to be completed individually; with no code sharing, and pledged.  Project questions will be posted to instructor so all can see answers within Slack.  

Quizzes will be given weekly to aid in recall and understanding of the course material.
