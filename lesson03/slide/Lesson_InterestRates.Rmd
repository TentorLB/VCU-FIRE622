## Nominal & Real Rates

## Definitions

Write out -- Explain the nominal interest rate

Write out -- Explain the real interest rate

## Nominal Interest Rates

- Nominal interest rates: the interest rates actually observed in financial markets
    - Used to determine fair present value and prices of securities
    - Two components:
        - Opportunity cost
        - Adjustments for individual security characteristics


## Real Riskless Interest Rates

- Additional purchasing power required to forego current consumption
    - What causes differences in nominal and real interest rates?
    - If you wish to earn a 3% real return and prices are expected to increase by 2%, what rate must you charge?
    - Irving Fisher first postulated that interest rates contain a premium for expected inflation.

# Class Problems

## Class Problem A

## Class Problem A: One Solution

If you deposit $500 in a bank account that earns 6 percent per year, how much total interest will you have earned after the third year? 

```{r A, echo=TRUE}
AccumulatedInterest <- 500 * 
                       ((1.06)*(1.06)*(1.06)*(1.06)*(1.06)*(1.06) - 1)

AccumulatedInterest

## Class Problem C

Calculate the present value of $5,000 received five years from today if your investments pay

- 6 percent compounded annually
- 8 percent compounded annually
- 10 percent compounded annually

What do your answers to these questions tell you about the relation between present values and interest rates and between present values and the number of compounding periods per year?

## Class Problem C: Solution [1]


```{r C, echo=TRUE}
r  <- 6
g  <- 1/(1+ r/100)
PV <- (((((5000 * g) * g) * g) * g) * g)
print(paste0(' Interest Rate ', as.character(r), ', PV ', as.character(PV))) 

r  <- 8
g  <- 1/(1+ r/100)
PV <- (((((5000 * g) * g) * g) * g) * g)
print(paste0(' Interest Rate ', as.character(r), ', PV ', as.character(PV))) 
```

## Class Problem C: Solution [2]

```{r C2, echo=TRUE}
r  <- 10
g  <- 1/(1+ r/100)
PV <- (((((5000 * g) * g) * g) * g) * g)
print(paste0(' Interest Rate ', as.character(r), ', PV ', as.character(PV))) 
```

# Terminology






## Implied Forward Rates

- A forward rate (f) is an expected rate on a short-term security that is to be originated at some point in the future
- The one-year forward rate for any year, N years into the future is:

$_Nf_1 = [(1+_1R_N)^{N}/(1+_1R_{N-1})^{N-1}]-1$


# Appendix

## Loanable Funds Theory {.flexbox .vcenter}

- Loanable funds theory explains interest rates and interest rate movements
- Views level of interest rates as resulting from factors that affect the supply of and demand for loanable funds
- Categorizes financial market participants – e.g., consumers, businesses, governments, and foreign participants – as net suppliers or demanders of funds

## Determinants of Household Savings {.flexbox .vcenter}

1. Interest rates and tax policy
2. Income and wealth: the greater the wealth or income, the greater the amount saved 
3. Attitudes about saving versus borrowing 
4. Credit availability: the greater the amount of easily obtainable consumer credit the lower the need to save 
5. Job security and belief in soundness of entitlements

## Determinants of Foreign Funds Invested in the U.S.  {.flexbox .vcenter}

1. Relative interest rates and returns on global investments
2. Expected exchange rate changes
3. Safe haven status of U.S. investments
4. Foreign central bank investments in the U.S.

## Federal Government Demand for Funds Concluded

- Governments borrow heavily in the markets for loanable funds
    - $23.19 trillion in 2016
- United States
    - National debt was $19.21 trillion in 2016
        - National debt (and interest payments on the national debt) have to be financed in large part by additional borrowing

## Business Demand for Funds

- Level of interest rates: 
    - When the cost of loanable funds is high (i.e., interest rates are high), businesses finance internally
- Expected future profitability vs. risk: 
    - The greater the number of profitable projects available to businesses, the greater the demand for loanable funds
- Expected economic growth

## Term Structure of Interest Rates:the Yield Curve

(a)  Upward sloping
(b)  Inverted or downward sloping
(c)  Flat

## Unbiased Expectations Theory

Current long-term interest rates (1RN) are geometric averages of current and expected future, E(Nr1), short-term interest rates

$_1R_N = [(1+_1R_1)(1+E(_2r_1))...(1+E(_Nr_n))]^{1/N}-1$

$_1R_N$  = actual N-period rate today
$N$      = term to maturity, N = 1, 2, …, 4, …
$_1R_1$  = actual current one-year rate today
E(_ir_1) = expected one-year rates for years, i = 1 to N

## Liquidity Premium Theory


$_1R_N = [(1+_1R_1)(1+E(_2r_1) + L_2)...(1+E(_Nr_n)+L_N)]^{1/N}-1$

$L_i$  = liquidity premium for period t
$L_2 < L_3 < … < L_N$

## Market Segmentation Theory

- Individual investors and FIs have specific maturity preferences
- Interest rates are determined by distinct supply and demand conditions within many maturity segments
- Investors and borrowers deviate from their preferred maturity segment only when adequately compensated to do so
