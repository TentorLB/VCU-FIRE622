# Interest Rate Terminology

## Nominal Interest Rates

- Nominal interest rates: the interest rates actually observed in financial markets
    - Used to determine fair present value and prices of securities
    - Two components:
        - Opportunity cost
        - Adjustments for individual security characteristics


## Real Riskless Interest Rates

- Additional purchasing power required to forego current consumption
    - What causes differences in nominal and real interest rates?
    - If you wish to earn a 3% real return and prices are expected to increase by 2%, what rate must you charge?
    - Irving Fisher first postulated that interest rates contain a premium for expected inflation.


## Loanable Funds Theory {.flexbox .vcenter}

- Loanable funds theory explains interest rates and interest rate movements
- Views level of interest rates as resulting from factors that affect the supply of and demand for loanable funds
- Categorizes financial market participants – e.g., consumers, businesses, governments, and foreign participants – as net suppliers or demanders of funds

## Determinants of Household Savings {.flexbox .vcenter}

1. Interest rates and tax policy
2. Income and wealth: the greater the wealth or income, the greater the amount saved 
3. Attitudes about saving versus borrowing 
4. Credit availability: the greater the amount of easily obtainable consumer credit the lower the need to save 
5. Job security and belief in soundness of entitlements

## Determinants of Foreign Funds Invested in the U.S.  {.flexbox .vcenter}

1. Relative interest rates and returns on global investments
2. Expected exchange rate changes
3. Safe haven status of U.S. investments
4. Foreign central bank investments in the U.S.

## Federal Government Demand for Funds Concluded

- Governments borrow heavily in the markets for loanable funds
    - $23.19 trillion in 2016
- United States
    - National debt was $19.21 trillion in 2016
        - National debt (and interest payments on the national debt) have to be financed in large part by additional borrowing

## Business Demand for Funds

- Level of interest rates: 
    - When the cost of loanable funds is high (i.e., interest rates are high), businesses finance internally
- Expected future profitability vs. risk: 
    - The greater the number of profitable projects available to businesses, the greater the demand for loanable funds
- Expected economic growth

## Term Structure of Interest Rates:the Yield Curve

(a)  Upward sloping
(b)  Inverted or downward sloping
(c)  Flat

## Unbiased Expectations Theory

Current long-term interest rates (1RN) are geometric averages of current and expected future, E(Nr1), short-term interest rates

$_1R_N = [(1+_1R_1)(1+E(_2r_1))...(1+E(_Nr_n))]^{1/N}-1$

$_1R_N$  = actual N-period rate today
$N$      = term to maturity, N = 1, 2, …, 4, …
$_1R_1$  = actual current one-year rate today
E(_ir_1) = expected one-year rates for years, i = 1 to N

## Liquidity Premium Theory


$_1R_N = [(1+_1R_1)(1+E(_2r_1) + L_2)...(1+E(_Nr_n)+L_N)]^{1/N}-1$

$L_i$  = liquidity premium for period t
$L_2 < L_3 < … < L_N$

## Market Segmentation Theory

- Individual investors and FIs have specific maturity preferences
- Interest rates are determined by distinct supply and demand conditions within many maturity segments
- Investors and borrowers deviate from their preferred maturity segment only when adequately compensated to do so


# Implied Forward Rates

- A forward rate (f) is an expected rate on a short-term security that is to be originated at some point in the future
- The one-year forward rate for any year, N years into the future is:

$_Nf_1 = [(1+_1R_N)^{N}/(1+_1R_{N-1})^{N-1}]-1$
