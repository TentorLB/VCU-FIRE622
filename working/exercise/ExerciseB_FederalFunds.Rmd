When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load Federal Funds Data

You will need to copy the file name from exercise A.

```{r FederalFunds}
# In R you may write anything after a hashmark!
# You have to remember where you downloaded the text file.
# If necessary you will need to locate the downloaded file in the explorer/finder.
# Also please use the slash (/) between directories 
# the backslash \ has special meaning.
fileName      <- 'C:/FIRE622/External/FEDFUNDS.csv'
yourDataFrame <- read.csv(fileName,colClasses = c("Date","numeric"))
```


## First Date of Federal Funds 

Let's determine the first date of the dataset.

```{r DataFrameFirstDate}
# The syntax used is dataframe[row numbers, column numbers]
yourDataFrame[1,1:2]   # This will echo the first row and include the first two columns
```

```{r DataFrameFirstDate02}
yourDataFrame[1,1]     # This will echo the first row, first column.
```

```{r DataFrameFirstDate03}
yourDataFrame[1,]$DATE # An alternative naming the column.
```
## Twenty-first Date of Federal Funds 

Your turn. Adjust the element returned to the twenty-first in the dataframe.

Your turn.  Replace <code>1</code> with <code>21</code> in *DataFrameTail*.  Then click the **Knit** button.


```{r DataFrameTwentyFirstDate}
# The syntax used is dataframe[row numbers, column numbers]
yourDataFrame[1,1:2]   # This will echo the first row and include the first two columns
```

```{r DataFrameTwentyFirstDate02}
yourDataFrame[1,1]     # This will echo the first row, first column.
```

```{r DataFrameTwentyFirstDate03}
yourDataFrame[1,]$DATE # An alternative naming the column.
```

## Last Date of Federal Funds 

Let's determine the dataset's last date.

```{r DataFrameLastDate}
# The syntax used is dataframe[row numbers, column numbers]
yourDataFrame[nrow(yourDataFrame),1:2]   # This will echo the last row and include the first two columns
```

```{r DataFrameLastDate02}
yourDataFrame[nrow(yourDataFrame),1]     # This will echo the last row, first column.
```

```{r DataFrameLastDate03}
yourDataFrame[nrow(yourDataFrame),]$DATE # An alternative naming the column.
```
## Number of rows in Federal Funds 

Let's determine the dataset's number of rows.

This was done above as an intermediant calculation, what command needs to go in the next block?

Your turn.  Replace <code>head</code> with <code>your selected command</code> in *DataFrameRows*. Then click the **Knit** button.


```{r DataFrameRows}
head(yourDataFrame)
```




## Exercise B Complete

Great job.  You have loaded the federal reserve funds rate into R; and looked at its contents in more detail.
