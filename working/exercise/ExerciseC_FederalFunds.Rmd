## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load Federal Funds Data
```{r FederalFunds}
# In R you may write anything after a hashmark!
# You have to remember where you downloaded the text file.
# If necessary you will need to locate the downloaded file in the explorer/finder.
# Also please use the slash (/) between directories 
# the backslash \ has special meaning.
yourDataFrame <- read.csv('C:/Users/Larry/Dropbox/Family/LBTentor/Professional/Teaching/Finance Class/Financial Institutions/Lessons/Lesson_FederalReserveBank/External/FEDFUNDS.csv')
```

## Plot Federal Funds 1

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Plot01, echo=FALSE}
plot(yourDataFrame)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Plot Federal Funds 2

This is alternative method of plotting that we will see again.

```{r Plot02, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(yourDataFrame, aes(x = DATE, y = FEDFUNDS)) +
    geom_point()

```
