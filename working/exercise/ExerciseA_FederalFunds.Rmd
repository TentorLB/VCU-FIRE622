## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load Federal Funds Data
```{r FederalFunds}
# In R you may write anything after a hashmark!
# 
# Create a directory "C:\FIRE622", this will be a folder to copy examples too, my code will work best if copied into this directory.
#
# You have to remember where you downloaded the text file.
# If necessary you will need to locate the downloaded file in the explorer/finder.
# Also please use the slash (/) between directories 
# the backslash \ has special meaning.
fileName      <- 'C:/FIRE622/External/FEDFUNDS.csv'
yourDataFrame <- read.csv(fileName,colClasses = c("Date","numeric"))
```

## Examine Federal Funds (head)

Let's look at the contents of the loaded dataframe.

The <code>head</code> function allows review of the first few elements.

```{r DataFrameHead}
head(yourDataFrame)
```

## Examine Federal Funds (tail)

The  <code>tail</code> function displays the last few elements of the dataset, opposite to the <code>head</code> function.

Your turn.  Replace <code>head</code> with <code>tail</code> in *DataFrameTail*.  Then click the **Knit** button.

```{r DataFrameTail}
head(yourDataFrame)
```


## Examine Federal Funds (summary)

The <code>summary</code> function displays information on each field in the dataset.

Your turn.  Replace <code>head</code> with <code>summary</code> in *DataFrameSummary*. Then click the **Knit** button.

```{r DataFrameSummary}
head(yourDataFrame)
```


## Exercise A Complete

Great job.  You have loaded the federal reserve funds rate into R; and examined its contents as the first step.
