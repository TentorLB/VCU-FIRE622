# Analysis Workflow

Recall that diagram depicts the workflow we are trying to implement as we do analysis.

# Dataset Background

[Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/invest) is a leading platform in peer-to-peer lending in the United States.  They streamline the borrowing process and assist matching investors with borrowers.  In order to attract investors they have provide a sample dataset of their loans.

We are interesting in profiling this data as a starting point.  We will need to become familiar with how Prosper has chosen to to assemble the dataset.  

# Analysis Objective

We will be examining the Prosper Loan Peer-to-Peer data set.  

We seek to understand the following questions for the loans.

1. Uniqueness of listing keys
    - Frequently computer systems create key records, in their base table these key records would not be duplicated.  As an example in the borrowers table their would be a unique BorrowerKey to identify a specific Borrower throughout the system.  A borrower could then create listings and listings may become funded loans.
    - You will need to examine any duplicate ListingKeys to see if any additional information is available and useful.
    - Then select how to deal with these duplicate records
  
2. Available DATE Fields.
    - What date fields are available to use in any analysis.
    - Are date fields always filled out?
    - Sequence the fields based on when they occur for the individual loan process.
        - Is the Credit Score always pulled after the Listing Date?

3. Amount originated by year
    - Table with the count, total loan amount and average loan size. 
    - Plot a bar graph of the number of loans per year. 
    - **New** Plot a box and whisker chart of the loan amount by origination year, explain how to interpret.

4. Amount of loans in different loan status
    - Table with the count, total loan amount and average loan size. 
    - Discuss, determine and select a way to reduce the number of categories for loan status to 3-4 groupings.  The guidng question is how to best group the existing status so that the following analysis can yield reasonable insights.
    - Table with the count, total loan amount and average loan size with the new loan status grouping. 
    
5. Amount of loans in different loan status groups and by year
    - Create a pivot table showing "Year" by "Loan Status Grouping"
    - **New** Look up function **spread**
    - Calculate the default rate by origination year.
    
    year amount status
    record 1
    record 2
    
    year current defaulted closed

    2006   10      20         40

6. Select an aspect of the dataset to explore.
    - A more detailed analysis will generate more points.


# Prosper Peer-to-Peer Data

## Import: Loan Data

```{r Import}

```

## Tidy

Clean up the fields as you deem necessary for the following analysis.  You may used additional chunks as necessary so you can confirm items step by step.

```{r Tidy}

```

## Analysis

### Listing Key Exploration

Check listing key for duplicates and select how to handle.

```{r ListingKeyExploration}

```


### Available Date fields

Here are the available date fields within the dataset, and sample data.

```{r AvailableDateFields}

```

### Date Field Exploration

Confirm date fields and sequencing.  This section should check the number of fields that actually are not N/A (is.na() and !is.na()).  Make certain you understand the data within these fields and any relationships, for instance is the listing always before the origination? 

```{r DateCheck}

```

[Comments on Dates available for analysis]

### Loan Origination Analysis

Let's examine the loans by origination year. Examine the count, total loan amount and average loan size. And plot a bar graph of the number of loans. 

```{r LoansbyYear}

```

**Loan Origination Comments**

Bar chart of loans by year

```{r LoansbyYearChart}

```
Box and whisker chart

```{r LoansbyYearWhisker}

```


[Comments on Origination Date Graphics, including details on the box and whisker charts and how to understand]

### Loan Status Analysis

Aggregate by Loan Status.

```{r AggregateLoanStatus}

```

Create simplified loan status group and aggregate.

```{r AggregateLoanStatusGroup}

```

### Examine the loan status groups by year

```{r LoanStatusGroupYear}

```

Pivot the values LoanOriginationYear on the row and LoanStatusGroup on the columns.

```{r Pivot}

```

[Comments on the default rate by orgination year]
