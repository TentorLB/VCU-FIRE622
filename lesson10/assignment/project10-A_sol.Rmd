# Dataset Background

[Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/invest) is a leading platform in peer-to-peer lending in the United States.  They streamline the borrowing process and assist matching investors with borrowers.  In order to attract investors they have provide a sample dataset of their loans.

We are interesting in profiling this data as a starting point.  We will need to become familiar with how Prosper has chosen to to assemble the dataset.  

# Analysis Objective

We will be examining the Prosper Loan Peer-to-Peer data set.  

We seek to understand the following questions for the loans.

1. Uniqueness of listing keys
    - Frequently computer systems create key records, in their base table these key records would not be duplicated.  As an example in the borrowers table their would be a unique BorrowerKey to identify a specific Borrower throughout the system.  A borrower could then create listings and listings may become funded loans.
    - You will need to examine any duplicate ListingKeys to see if any additional information is available and useful.
    - Then select how to deal with these duplicate records
  
2. Available DATE Fields.
    - What date fields are available to use in any analysis.
    - Are date fields always filled out?
    - Sequence the fields based on when they occur for the individual loan process.
        - Is the Credit Score always pulled after the Listing Date?

3. Amount originated by year
    - Table with the count, total loan amount and average loan size. 
    - Plot a bar graph of the number of loans per year. 
    - **New** Plot a box and whisker chart of the loan amount by origination year, explain how to interpret.

4. Amount of loans in different loan status
    - Table with the count, total loan amount and average loan size. 
    - Discuss, determine and select a way to reduce the number of categories for loan status to 3-4 groupings.  The guidng question is how to best group the existing status so that the following analysis can yield reasonable insights.
    - Table with the count, total loan amount and average loan size with the new loan status grouping. 
    
5. Amount of loans in different loan status groups and by year
    - Create a pivot table showing "Year" by "Loan Status Grouping"
    - **New** Look up function **spread**
    - Calculate the default rate by origination year.

6. Select an aspect of the dataset to explore.
    - A more detailed analysis will generate more points.


# Prosper Peer-to-Peer Data

## Import: Loan Data

```{r Import}

fileData              <- '../data/prosperLoanData.csv'

LoanColClasses <- 
  c( "character", "integer",   "character", "character", "integer"
   , "character", "character", "numeric",   "numeric",   "numeric"
   , "numeric",   "numeric",   "numeric",   "integer",   "character"
   , "numeric",   "integer",   "character", "character", "character"
   , "integer",   "character", "character", "character", "character"
   , "integer",   "integer",   "character", "integer",   "integer"

   , "numeric",   "numeric",   "integer",   "integer",   "numeric"
   , "integer"
    )

loansInitial    <- read.csv(fileData, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#loans          <- read.csv(fileData, header = TRUE, sep = ",", colClasses = LoanColClasses)  # Specifing column classes had issues based on file format having all fields quoted.

summary(loansInitial)
```

## Tidy

Clean up the fields as you deem necessary for the following analysis.  You may used additional chunks as necessary so you can confirm items step by step.

```{r Tidy}
# Convert dates from character strings
loansInitial$ListingCreationDate_ <- as.Date(loansInitial$ListingCreationDate)
loansInitial$ClosedDate_          <- as.Date(loansInitial$ClosedDate)
loansInitial$DateCreditPulled_    <- as.Date(loansInitial$DateCreditPulled)
loansInitial$LoanOriginationDate_ <- as.Date(loansInitial$LoanOriginationDate)

# Convert factors from character strings
loansInitial$CreditGrade         <- as.factor(loansInitial$CreditGrade)
loansInitial$LoanStatus          <- as.factor(loansInitial$LoanStatus)
loansInitial$IsBorrowerHomeowner <- as.factor(loansInitial$IsBorrowerHomeowner)
loansInitial$CurrentlyInGroup    <- as.factor(loansInitial$CurrentlyInGroup)

object.size(loansInitial)        # 104,982,360 bytes with default

nrow(loansInitial)

```

## Analysis

### Listing Key Exploration

Check listing key for duplicates and select how to handle.

```{r ListingKeyExploration}

# Checking some details
 listingKeyUnique <- 
  loansInitial[,1:5] %>% 
  group_by(ListingKey) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

 listingKeyDup    <- 
   listingKeyUnique %>% 
   filter(count>1) %>% 
   arrange(desc(count))
 
 loansDupListingKey <- 
   loansInitial %>% 
   filter(ListingKey %in% listingKeyDup$ListingKey) %>%
   arrange(ListingKey)
 
 loansUniqueListingKey <-
   loansInitial %>% 
   filter(!(ListingKey %in% listingKeyDup$ListingKey)) %>%
   arrange(ListingKey)
 
 if (nrow(loansInitial) == nrow(loansDupListingKey)+nrow(loansUniqueListingKey)) {
   print ("Duplicates have been removed, count makes sense.")
 } else {
   print ("Error in removing duplicate records")
 }

 loans <- loansUniqueListingKey
 nrow(loans)
 
```


### Available Date fields

Here are the available date fields within the dataset, and sample data.

```{r AvailableDateFields}
nameVector <- colnames(loans)
indexDate  <- grepl("Date",colnames(loans))

nameVector[indexDate]

loansUniqueListingKey[1:10,nameVector[indexDate]]
```

### Date Field Exploration

Confirm date fields and sequencing.  This section should check the number of fields that actually are not N/A (is.na() and !is.na()).  Make certain you understand the data within these fields and any relationships, for instance is the listing always before the origination? 

```{r DateCheck}
DateCheck   <- loans[,nameVector[indexDate]]
countRecord <- nrow(DateCheck)

#  Present record counts
cat("Case Zero Counts \n"
    , format(countRecord,digits=10,width=10),                                 " : Total records \n"
    , format(sum(!is.na(DateCheck$ListingCreationDate_)),digits=10,width=10), " : Listing Date Available \n"
    , format(sum(!is.na(DateCheck$DateCreditPulled_)),digits=10,width=10),    " : Credit Pulled Date Available \n"
    , format(sum(!is.na(DateCheck$LoanOriginationDate_)),digits=10,width=10), " : Origination Date Available \n"
    , format(sum(!is.na(DateCheck$ClosedDate_)),digits=10,width=10),          " : Closed Date Available \n"
     )

# Check if ListingCreationDate is always prior to DateCreditPulled
Check01 <- (DateCheck$ListingCreationDate_ <= DateCheck$DateCreditPulled_)
cat("Case One Counts \n"
    , format(countRecord,digits=10,width=10),     " : Total records \n"
    , format(sum(Check01),digits=10,width=10),    " : Listing Date         <= Credit Pulled Date \n"
    , format(sum(!Check01),digits=10,width=10),   " : Credit Pulled Date   <= Listing Date \n" )

# Check if DateCreditPulled is always prior to LoanOriginationDate
Check02 <- (DateCheck$DateCreditPulled_    <= DateCheck$LoanOriginationDate_)
cat("Case Two Counts \n"
    , format(countRecord,digits=10,width=10),     " : Total records \n"
    , format(sum(Check02),digits=10,width=10),    " : Credit Pulled Date   <= Origination Date \n"
    , format(sum(!Check02),digits=10,width=10),   " : Origination Date     <= Credit Pulled Date \n" )

# Check if DateCreditPulled is always prior to LoanOriginationDate
Check03 <- (DateCheck$ListingCreationDate_    <= DateCheck$LoanOriginationDate_)
cat("Case Three Counts \n"
    , format(countRecord,digits=10,width=10),     " : Total records \n"
    , format(sum(Check03),digits=10,width=10),    " : Listing Date         <= Origination Date \n"
    , format(sum(!Check03),digits=10,width=10),   " : Origination Date     <= Listing Date \n" )

# Check if DateCreditPulled is always prior to LoanOriginationDate
isAvailableClosedDate <- !is.na(DateCheck$ClosedDate_)
Check04               <- (DateCheck$LoanOriginationDate_[isAvailableClosedDate] <= DateCheck$ClosedDate_[isAvailableClosedDate])
cat("Case Four Counts\n"
    , format(countRecord,digits=10,width=10),     " : Total records \n"
    , format(length(Check04),digits=10,width=10), " : ClosedDate Available \n"
    , format(sum(Check04),digits=10,width=10),    " : Origination Date     <= ClosedDate \n"
    , format(sum(!Check04),digits=10,width=10),   " : Closed Date          <= Origination Date \n" )

```

```{r}
ProsDate5 <- DateCheck$ClosedDate <= DateCheck$DateCreditPulled

if (sum(ProsDate5 == "FALSE") == 0) {print("Date credit pulled date is always after first recorded credit line")} else {print("Sometimes the credit pulled date is before the first credit line")}
```

### Loan Origination Analysis

Let's examine the loans by origination year. Examine the count, total loan amount and average loan size. And plot a bar graph of the number of loans. 

```{r LoansbyYear}
loans$LoanOriginationYear <- year(loans$LoanOriginationDate_)

#loans$LoanOriginationYear[1:10]

loansByYear <-
  loans %>%
  group_by(LoanOriginationYear) %>%
  summarise(count=n(),loanAmount=sum(LoanOriginalAmount), loanAverage=sum(LoanOriginalAmount)/n() )
loansByYear
```

**Loan Origination Comments**

Bar chart of loans by year

```{r LoansbyYearChart}


p           <- ggplot(data=loansByYear, aes(x=as.character(LoanOriginationYear),y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Loans")

p 
```
Box and whisker chart

```{r LoansbyYearWhisker}
ggplot(loans, aes(as.character(LoanOriginationYear), LoanOriginalAmount, group =LoanOriginationYear )) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Loan Amount") +
  xlab("Year")
```

### Loan Status Analysis

Aggregate by Loan Status.

```{r AggregateLoanStatus}
loanStatus <-
  loans %>%
  group_by(LoanStatus) %>%
  summarise(count=n(),AvgLoan=mean(LoanOriginalAmount))
loanStatus
```

Create simplified loan status group and aggregate.

```{r AggregateLoanStatusGroup}
loans$LoanStatusGroup <- ifelse(loans$LoanStatus %in% c("Completed","FinalPaymentInProgress"),"Complete"
                                ,ifelse(loans$LoanStatus %in% c("Chargedoff","Defaulted","Cancelled"),"Default"
                                ,ifelse(loans$LoanStatus %in% c("Current"),"Current","PastDue")))
loanStatusGroup <-
  loans %>%
  group_by(LoanStatusGroup) %>%
  summarise(count=n(),AvgLoan=mean(LoanOriginalAmount))
loanStatusGroup

```

### Examine the loan status groups by year

```{r LoanStatusGroupYear}
loanStatusGroupYear <-
  loans %>%
  group_by(LoanOriginationYear,LoanStatusGroup) %>%
  summarise(count=n(),AvgLoan=mean(LoanOriginalAmount))
loanStatusGroupYear
```

Pivot the values LoanOriginationYear on the row and LoanStatusGroup on the columns.

```{r Pivot}

pivot <- 
  loanStatusGroupYear[,c("LoanOriginationYear","LoanStatusGroup","count")] %>% 
  spread(LoanStatusGroup,count) %>%
  mutate(Current=coalesce(Current, 0L),
         Default=coalesce(Default, 0L),
         PastDue=coalesce(PastDue, 0L),
         DefaultRate=Default/(Complete+Current+Default+PastDue))
pivot

```
