# Federal Reserve Update March 2020 .font50[1]

[Press Releases (suggested filter for ☑ Monetary Policy) ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm)
- [Federal Reserve Action, March 31](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200331a.htm "FIMA Repo")
    - The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced the establishment of a temporary **repurchase agreement facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility)** to help support the smooth functioning of financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury market, and thus maintain the supply of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The FIMA Repo Facility will allow FIMA account holders, which consist of central banks and other international monetary authorities with accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to enter into repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve. In these transactions, FIMA account holders temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by **providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities** in the open market. It should also serve, along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Reserve has established with other central banks, to help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets.

# SEC Introduction

## Mission and Vision
Source: [SEC What We Do](https://www.sec.gov/Article/whatwedo.html)

- **Mission** of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to 
    - **protect investors**, 
    - **maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets**, and
    - **facilitate capital formation**.
- As our nation's securities exchanges mature into global for-profit competitors, there is even greater need for **sound market regulation**.
- And the common interest of all Americans in a
    - growing economy that produces jobs,
    - improves our standard of living, and 
    - protects the value of our savings 
    - means that all of the SEC's actions must be taken with an eye toward promoting the capital formation that is necessary to sustain economic growth.

---
# SEC Introduction

- The laws and rules that govern the securities industry in the United States derive from a **simple and straightforward concept**: all investors, whether large institutions or private individuals, should have access to certain basic facts about an investment prior to buying it, and so long as they hold it. To achieve this, the SEC requires public companies to **disclose meaningful financial and other information to the public.** 
- This provides a common pool of knowledge for all investors to use to judge for themselves whether to buy, sell, or hold a particular security. Only through the **steady flow of timely, comprehensive, and accurate information can people make sound investment decisions**.
- The result of this information flow is a **far more active, efficient, and transparent capital market that facilitates the capital formation** so important to our nation's economy.
- The SEC oversees the key participants in the securities world, including 
    - **securities exchanges**, 
    - **securities brokers and dealers**,
    - **investment advisors**, and 
    - **mutual funds**. 
    - Here the SEC is concerned primarily with promoting the disclosure of important market-related information, maintaining fair dealing, and protecting against fraud.

---
# SEC Introduction

- One of the major sources of information on which the SEC relies to bring enforcement action is investors themselves — another reason that educated and careful investors are so critical to the functioning of efficient markets. To help support investor education, the SEC offers the public a wealth of educational information on this Internet website, which also includes the **EDGAR database of disclosure documents that public companies are required to file** with the Commission.
- Though it is the primary overseer and regulator of the U.S. securities markets, the SEC works closely with many other institutions, including 
    - Congress, 
    - other federal departments and agencies,
    - the self-regulatory organizations (e.g. the stock exchanges),
    - state securities regulators, and 
    - various private sector organizations.

# SEC Creation

- **Setting**: After the Great Crash of 1929, public confidence in the markets plummeted, a consensus that for the economy to recover, the public's faith in the capital markets needed to be restored. Congress held hearings to identify the problems and search for solutions.
- **Result**: After these hearding, the Security Act of 1933 was passed and the followed year saw the Security Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC.
- **Goal**: Designed to restore investor confidence in our capital markets by providing investors and the markets with more **reliable information** and **clear rules of honest dealing**. The main purposes of these laws can be reduced to two common-sense notions:
    - Companies publicly offering securities for investment dollars **must tell the public the truth** about their businesses, the securities they are selling, and the risks involved in investing.
    - People who sell and trade securities – brokers, dealers, and exchanges – must treat investors **fairly and honestly, putting investors' interests** first.

# Answer 10-A

.font150[.center[
KDO pays $70,500,000 ($23.50 x 3,000,000) for the shares and receives $75,000,000 ($25 x 3,000,000) on the sale. The investment bank’s profit is $4,500,000, and the stock price is $25 since that is what the public pays. From the perspective of KDO, the $4,500,000 represents the commission that it must pay to issue the stock.
