    - Markets that trade debt securities with maturities of one year or less (e.g., CDs and  U.S. Treasury bills)
little or no risk of capital loss, but low return

## Regulation of Financial Institutions

- FIs are heavily regulated to protect society at large from market failures
- Regulations impose a burden on FIs;  before the financial crisis, U.S. regulatory changes were deregulatory in nature
- Regulators attempt to maximize social welfare while minimizing the burden imposed by regulation

## Enterprise Risk Management

- Enterprise risk management
      - Recognizes the importance of managing the combined impact of the full spectrum of risks as an interrelated risk portfolio
- Popularity rose as a result of the failure of advanced risk measurement and management systems to detect exposures that led to the financial crisis
- Stresses importance of building a strong risk culture 

## Globalization of Financial Markets and Institutions

- The pool of savings from foreign investors is increasing and investors look to diversify globally now more than ever before
- Information on foreign markets and investments is becoming readily accessible and deregulation across the globe is allowing even greater access to foreign markets
- International mutual funds allow diversified foreign investment with low transactions costs
- Global capital flows are larger than ever
