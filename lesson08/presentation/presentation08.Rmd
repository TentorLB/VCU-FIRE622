  - First established in the early 1900s as self-help organizations.
  - Members deposit savings and the funds are lent to other members.
  - CUs are prohibited from serving the general public
      - members are required to have a common bond of occupation, association, etc.
      - E.g., university-affiliated CUs, police CUs, etc.
  - Because C U s are nonprofit organizations, their earnings are not taxed.
  - May offer higher interest rates than commercial banks on deposits.
  - May charge lower interest rates than commercial banks on loans.

## Finance Companies (FC)

There are three major types of finance companies (F Cs).
Sales finance institutions specialize in loans to customers of a particular retailer or manufacturer.
Personal credit institutions specialize in installment and other loans to consumers.
Business credit institutions specialize in business loans, especially through equipment leasing and factoring.
Factoring is the process of purchasing accounts receivable from corporations, usually with no recourse to the seller should the receivables go bad.

## Finance Companoies (FC) - 2

Industry assets were $1,820.6 billion in 2016.
FC industry is highly concentrated.
The 20 largest FCs account for more than 65% of industry assets.
Many of the largest F Cs tend to wholly owned or captive subsidiaries of major manufacturing companies.
E.g., Ford Motor Credit is a subsidiary of Ford Motor.

--

## FC Balance Sheets

Some finance companies make loans to riskier customers at higher interest rates than C Bs.
Subprime lenders are F Cs that lend to high-risk customers.
Loan sharks are subprime lenders that charge unfairly exorbitant rates to desperate, subprime borrowers.
Payday lenders provide short-term cash advances that are often due when borrowers receive their next paycheck.
An estimated 12 million Americans used payday loans in 2016 .

---

## FC Balance Sheets - 2

F Cs often have advantages over C Bs with respect to business loans because F Cs:
Are not subject to regulations that restrict the type of products and services they can offer.
Do not accept depositsâ€”accordingly, bank-type regulators do not monitor their behavior.
Often have substantial industry and product expertise.
Are more willing to accept risky customers.
Generally have lower overhead than C Bs.

## FC Balanace Sheets - 3

Real estate loans.
Second mortgages are in the form of home equity loans, i.e., loans that let customers borrow on a line of credit secured with a second mortgage on their home.
Securitized mortgage assets are mortgages purchased and used as assets backing secondary market securities.
Mortgage servicing is a fee-related activity whereby the flow of mortgage repayments is collected and passed on to investors in whole mortgage loan packages or securitization vehicles.

---

## FC Performance

Problems arose in the F C industry in the mid- and late-2000s with the crash of the market for subprime mortgage loans.
Many F Cs saw sharply lower equity values.

F Cs are subject to state-imposed usury ceilings and additional restrictions have been imposed on payday loans in many states.
Because F Cs do not accept deposits, they are not subject to the extensive oversight common among C Bs, S I s, and C U s .
F C industry improved in the mid-200s and early 2010s.
In the mid-2010s, industry median R O E rose to 9.33%, up from 6.61% during the height of the crisis, for business credit institutions.
During the mid-2010s, industry median R O E rose to 13.73%, up from 5.31% during the height of the crisis, for personal credit institutions.

## FC Performanace 

Between 2005 and 2007, home prices began to fall and borrowers faced rising interest rates, resulting in more people defaulting on their mortgages.
Mortgage loan delinquencies and small business loan failure rates peaked in 2008 and 2009, hurting overall profitability.
Crash in the subprime mortgage market led to serious problems for the U.S. and worldwide economies as a whole.
Countrywide Financial failed, G MAC Financial Services was forced to convert to a bank holding company to prevent failure, and C I T Group also failed.

Financial crisis issues remained even into 2016.
Industry receivables stood at \$1.42 trillion in the mid-2010s, down from \$1.93 trillion during the crisis, while industry employment was 562,400 in the mid-2010s, down from 715,900 as the crisis began.
